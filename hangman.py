# make a dictionary from a dictionary file ('dictionary.txt', see above)
# dictionary keys are word sizes (1, 2, 3, 4, …, 12), and values are lists of words
# for example, dictionary = { 2 : ['Ms', 'ad'], 3 : ['cat', 'dog', 'sun'] }
# if a word has the size more than 12 letters, put it into the list with the key equal to 12  WHY?

        # __ P P __ E    lives: 4   XOOOO        hidden word and lives

        # ask the user to guess a letter

        # update the list of chosen letters

        # if the letter is correct update the hidden word,
        # else update the number of lives
        # and print interactive messages      

        # END GAME LOOP   (INNER PROGRAM LOOP)

        # check if the user guesses the word correctly or lost all lives,
        # if yes finish the game

    # ask if the user wants to continue playing, 
    # if yes start a new game, otherwise terminate the program
